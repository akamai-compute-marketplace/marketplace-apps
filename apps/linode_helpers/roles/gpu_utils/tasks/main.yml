# GPU helper.

# This helper contains 2 files:
# - detect_gpu.yml
# - nvidia.yml

#---------------
# detect_gpu.yml
#---------------

# detect_gpu.yml should be called at the playbook level in the provision.yml.
# We need to set `gpu_required` to a boolean value. Here is the expected outcome
# for each:

# gpu_required: true
# The playbook requires that the instance has GPUs. This task will write `gpu_devices`,
# `gpu_count`, and `_has_gpu` to the vars file. If no GPUs are found, the playbook
# will fail because the declared state cannot be achieved.

# gpu_required: false
# The playbook will continue forward upon failure. This will write `_has_gpu` as false to the vars file.
# One reason why we might want this is because some apps can be deployed on GPUs or not.

# This is an example on how to call this from the provision.yml:

# - name: Ensure instance has GPU before continuing
#   import_tasks: ../linode_helpers/roles/gpu_utils/tasks/main.yml
#   vars:
#     gpu_required: true

#-----------
# nvidia.yml
#-----------

# nvidia.yml should be called at the role level and imported as a role.
# The task that calls nvidia.yml should pass the following variables:

# install_nvidia: true
# Passing this will unbind the default driver on the PCI bus and enable
# the nvidia one.

# docker_gpu_enable: true
# Passing this variable along will ensure that if docker is on the system that we update the
# runtime to use the GPU. The service is gracefully restarted.

# This task should only be called after detect_gpu.yml as it utilizes `gpu_devices` to bind/unbind drivers.
# Example, a task that is run role-level:

# - name: Install NVIDIA drivers
#   import_role:
#     name: gpu_utils
#   vars:
#     install_nvidia: true
#     docker_gpu_enable: true
