# Linode Weaviate One-Click App

Deploy a Weaviate vector database with GPU acceleration on Akamai Connected Cloud using the latest Weaviate Docker image. This One-Click App provides a fully configured Weaviate instance with NVIDIA GPU support for high-performance vector similarity search and AI-powered semantic search capabilities. The Weaviate Docker image is ideal for single instance evaluation and deployment for small to mid-size workloads.

## Linode Helpers Included

| Name  | Action  |
| :---  | :---    |
| Hostname   | The Hostname module uses `dnsdomainname -A` to detect the Linode's FQDN and write to the `/etc/hosts` file. This defaults to the Linode's automatically assigned rDNS. To use a custom FQDN see [Configure your Linode for Reverse DNS](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/configure-your-linode-for-reverse-DNS/).  |
| Update Packages   | The Update Packages module performs apt update and upgrade actions as root.  |
| UFW   | The UFW module will utilize a list generated by `linode_helpers/ufw/ufwgen.yml` in the `group_vars/linode/vars` and enables the service.  |
| Fail2Ban   | The Fail2Ban module installs, activates and enables the Fail2Ban service.  |
| Create DNS Record | The Create DNS Record module creates DNS records for domains and subdomains using the Linode API, including validation of DNS propagation. |
| Secure SSH | The Secure SSH module configures SSH security settings including disabling root login and password authentication when appropriate. |
| SSH Key | The SSH Key module manages SSH key deployment for the sudo user, supporting both custom public keys and account keys. |
| Certbot SSL | The Certbot SSL module handles SSL/TLS certificate installation via Let's Encrypt, supporting Nginx certificate issuance. |
| Docker | The Docker module installs Docker CE and Docker Compose for container management. |

## Getting Started

After deployment, your credentials and API keys are stored in `/home/[username]/.credentials`.

## Use our API

Customers can choose to deploy Weaviate through the Linode Marketplace or directly using API. Before using the commands below, you will need to create an [API token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/linode-api/get-started/#create-an-api-token) or configure [linode-cli](https://www.linode.com/products/cli/) on an environment.

Make sure that the following values are updated at the top of the code block before running the commands:
- TOKEN - Your Linode API token
- ROOT_PASS - Root password for the Linode
- USERNAME - System user that will be created
