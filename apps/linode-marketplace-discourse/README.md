# Akamai Cloud Discourse Quick Deploy App

Discourse is an open-source online community and discussion platform hosted in a cloud environment. It provides forums where users can create topics, post replies, share knowledge, and communicate with each other. Our Quick Deploy App creates Discourse in a Docker container as the deployment method.

## Linode Helpers Included

| Name | Description | Actions
| :--- | :---        | :---
| UFW   | Add UFW firewalls to the Linode  | The UFW module will import a `ufw_rules.yml` provided in `roles/common/tasks` and enables the service.  |
| Certbot SSL   | Generates and sets auto-renew for Certbot SSL certificates  | The Certbot module installs Certbot Python plugin and certificates based on the webserver detected by Ansible. The default renewal cron runs Mondays at 00:00AM and can be manually edited. |
| Fail2Ban   | Installs, activates and enables Fail2Ban  | The Fail2Ban module installs, activates and enables the Fail2Ban service.   |
| Hostname   | Assigns a hostname to the Linode based on domains provided via UDF or uses default rDNS. | The Hostname module accepts a UDF to assign a FQDN and write to the `/etc/hosts` file. If no domain is provided the default `ip.linodeusercontent.com` rDNS will be used. For consistency, DNS and SSL configurations should use the Hostname generated `_domain` var when possible. |
| Secure SSH   | Performs standard SSH hardening.  | The Secure SSH module writes to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to prevent password authentication and enable public key authentication for all users, including root.  |
| Sudo User  | Creates limited `sudo` user with variable supplied username.  | Creates limited user from UDF supplied `username.` Note that usernames containing illegal characters will cause the play to fail. |
| SSH Key   | Writes SSH pubkey to `sudo` user's `authorized_keys`.  | Writes UDF supplied `pubkey` to `/home/$username/.ssh/authorized_keys`. To add a SSH key to `root` please use [Cloud Manager SSH Keys](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cloud-manager/guides/manage-ssh-keys/).   |
| Update Packages   | Performs standard apt updates and upgrades. | The Update Packages module performs apt update and upgrade actions as root.  |
