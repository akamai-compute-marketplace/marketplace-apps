## Linode Helpers Included

| Name | Description | Actions
| :--- | :---        | :---
| UFW   | Add UFW firewalls to the Linode  | The UFW module will import a `ufw_rules.yml` provided in `roles/common/tasks` and enables the service.  |
| Certbot SSL   | Generates and sets auto-renew for Certbot SSL certificates  | The Certbot module installs Certbot Python plugin and certificates based on the webserver detected by Ansible. The default renewal cron runs Mondays at 00:00AM and can be manually edited. |
| Fail2Ban   | Installs, activates and enables Fail2Ban  | The Fail2Ban module installs, activates and enables the Fail2Ban service.   |
| Hostname   | Assigns a hostname to the Linode based on domains provided via UDF or uses default rDNS. | The Hostname module accepts a UDF to assign a FQDN and write to the `/etc/hosts` file. If no domain is provided the default `ip.linodeusercontent.com` rDNS will be used. For consistency, DNS and SSL configurations should use the Hostname generated `_domain` var when possible. |
| Secure SSH   | Performs standard SSH hardening.  | The Secure SSH module writes to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to prevent password authentication and enable public key authentication for all users, including root.  |  
| Sudo User  | Creates limited `sudo` user with variable supplied username.  | Creates limited user from UDF supplied `username.` Note that usernames containing illegal characters will cause the play to fail. |
| SSH Key   | Writes SSH pubkey to `sudo` user's `authorized_keys`.  | Writes UDF supplied `pubkey` to `/home/$username/.ssh/authorized_keys`. To add a SSH key to `root` please use [Cloud Manager SSH Keys](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cloud-manager/guides/manage-ssh-keys/).   |
| Update Packages   | Performs standard apt updates and upgrades. | The Update Packages module performs apt update and upgrade actions as root.  |

## Use our API

Customers can choose to the deploy the InfluxDB app through the Linode Marketplace or directly using API. Before using the commands below, you will need to create an [API token](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/linode-api/get-started/#create-an-api-token) or configure [linode-cli](https://www.linode.com/products/cli/) on an environment.

Make sure that the following values are updated at the top of the code block before running the commands:
- TOKEN
- ROOT_PASS

SHELL:
```
export TOKEN="YOUR API TOKEN"
export ROOT_PASS="aComplexP@ssword"

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
    -X POST -d '{
      "backups_enabled": true,
      "swap_size": 512,
      "image": "linode/ubuntu2204",
      "root_pass": "${ROOT_PASS}",
      "stackscript_id": 1298017,
      "authorized_users": [
        "myUser",
        "secondaryUser"
      ],
      "booted": true,
      "label": "linode123",
      "type": "g6-standard-2",
      "region": "us-east",
      "group": "Linode-Group"
    }' \
https://api.linode.com/v4/linode/instances
```

CLI:
```
export TOKEN="YOUR API TOKEN"
export ROOT_PASS="aComplexP@ssword"

linode-cli linodes create \
  --label linode123 \
  --root_pass ${ROOT_PASS} \
  --booted true \
  --stackscript_id 1298017 \
  --region us-east \
  --type g6-standard-2 \
  --authorized_keys "ssh-rsa AAAA_valid_public_ssh_key_123456785== user@their-computer"
  --authorized_users "myUser"
  --authorized_users "secondaryUser"
```
