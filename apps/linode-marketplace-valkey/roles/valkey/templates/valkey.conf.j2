# Valkey configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, the server must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./valkey-server /path/to/valkey.conf

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
# Note that option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Sentinel. Since the server always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# Included paths may contain wildcards. All files matching the wildcards will
# be included in alphabetical order.
# Note that if an include path contains a wildcards but no files match it when
# the server is started, the include statement will be ignored and no error will
# be emitted.  It is safe, therefore, to include wildcard files from empty
# directories.

################################## MODULES #####################################

# Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules
# it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.
#
# loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so
# loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so

################################## NETWORK #####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, the server listens
# for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
# Each address can be prefixed by "-", which means that the server will not fail to
# start if the address is not available. Being not available only refers to
# addresses that does not correspond to any network interface. Addresses that
# are already in use will always fail, and unsupported protocols will always BE
# silently skipped.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1     # listens on two specific IPv4 addresses
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1              # listens on loopback IPv4 and IPv6
# bind * -::*                     # like the default, all available interfaces
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running the server is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force the server to listen only on the
# IPv4 and IPv6 (if available) loopback interface addresses (this means the server
# will only be able to accept client connections from the same host that it is
# running on).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# COMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
#
# You will also need to set a password unless you explicitly disable protected
# mode.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind  127.0.0.1 -::1

# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# the server instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and the default user has no password, the server
# only accepts local connections from the IPv4 address (127.0.0.1), IPv6 address
# (::1) or Unix domain sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to the server
# even if no authentication is configured.
protected-mode yes

# The server uses default hardened security configuration directives to reduce the
# attack surface on innocent users. Therefore, several sensitive configuration
# directives are immutable, and some potentially-dangerous commands are blocked.
#
# Configuration directives that control files that the server writes to (e.g., 'dir'
# and 'dbfilename') and that aren't usually modified during runtime
# are protected by making them immutable.
#
# Commands that can increase the attack surface of the server and that aren't usually
# called by users are blocked by default.
#
# These can be exposed to either all connections or just local ones by setting
# each of the configs listed below to either of these values:
#
# no    - Block for any connection (remain immutable)
# yes   - Allow for any connection (no protection)
# local - Allow only for local connections. Ones originating from the
#         IPv4 address (127.0.0.1), IPv6 address (::1) or Unix domain sockets.

#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need a high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connection issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to get the desired effect.

# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Force network equipment in the middle to consider the connection to be
#    alive.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.

################################# TLS/SSL #####################################

# By default, TLS/SSL is disabled. To enable it, the "tls-port" configuration
# directive can be used to define TLS-listening ports. To enable TLS on the
# default port, use:
#
port 0
tls-port 6379

# Configure a X.509 certificate and private key to use for authenticating the
# server to connected clients, masters or cluster peers.  These files should be
# PEM formatted.
#
tls-cert-file {{ valkey_ssl_server_cert }} 
tls-key-file {{ valkey_ssl_server_key }}
#
# If the key file is encrypted using a passphrase, it can be included here
# as well.
#
# tls-key-file-pass secret

# Normally the server uses the same certificate for both server functions (accepting
# connections) and client functions (replicating from a master, establishing
# cluster bus connections, etc.).
#
# Sometimes certificates are issued with attributes that designate them as
# client-only or server-only certificates. In that case it may be desired to use
# different certificates for incoming (server) and outgoing (client)
# connections. To do that, use the following directives:
#
{% for item in range(1, (client_count + 1)) %}
tls-client-cert-file {{ valkey_ssl_certs_directory }}/client{{ item }}.crt
tls-client-key-file {{ valkey_ssl_keys_directory }}/client{{ item }}.key.pem
{% endfor %}
#
# If the key file is encrypted using a passphrase, it can be included here
# as well.
#
# tls-client-key-file-pass secret

# Configure a DH parameters file to enable Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange,
# required by older versions of OpenSSL (<3.0). Newer versions do not require
# this configuration and recommend against it.
#
# tls-dh-params-file valkey.dh

# Configure a CA certificate(s) bundle or directory to authenticate TLS/SSL
# clients and peers. The server requires an explicit configuration of at least one
# of these, and will not implicitly use the system wide configuration.
#
tls-ca-cert-file {{ valkey_ssl_ca_directory }}/ca.crt
# tls-ca-cert-dir 

# By default, clients (including replica servers) on a TLS port are required
# to authenticate using valid client side certificates.
#
# If "no" is specified, client certificates are not required and not accepted.
# If "optional" is specified, client certificates are accepted and must be
# valid if provided, but are not required.
#
# tls-auth-clients no
# tls-auth-clients optional

# By default, a replica does not attempt to establish a TLS connection
# with its master.
#
# Use the following directive to enable TLS on replication links.
#
tls-replication yes

# By default, the cluster bus uses a plain TCP connection. To enable
# TLS for the bus protocol, use the following directive:
#
# tls-cluster yes

# By default, only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are enabled and it is highly recommended
# that older formally deprecated versions are kept disabled to reduce the attack surface.
# You can explicitly specify TLS versions to support.
# Allowed values are case insensitive and include "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2",
# "TLSv1.3" (OpenSSL >= 1.1.1) or any combination.
# To enable only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, use:
#
tls-protocols "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"

# Configure allowed ciphers.  See the ciphers(1ssl) manpage for more information
# about the syntax of this string.
#
# Note: this configuration applies only to <= TLSv1.2.
#
# tls-ciphers DEFAULT:!MEDIUM

# Configure allowed TLSv1.3 ciphersuites.  See the ciphers(1ssl) manpage for more
# information about the syntax of this string, and specifically for TLSv1.3
# ciphersuites.
#
# tls-ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

# When choosing a cipher, use the server's preference instead of the client
# preference. By default, the server follows the client's preference.
#
# tls-prefer-server-ciphers yes

# By default, TLS session caching is enabled to allow faster and less expensive
# reconnections by clients that support it. Use the following directive to disable
# caching.
#
# tls-session-caching no

# Change the default number of TLS sessions cached. A zero value sets the cache
# to unlimited size. The default size is 20480.
#
# tls-session-cache-size 5000

# Change the default timeout of cached TLS sessions. The default timeout is 300
# seconds.

################################# GENERAL #####################################

# By default the server does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that the server will write a pid file in /var/run/valkey.pid when daemonized.
# When the server is supervised by upstart or systemd, this parameter has no impact.
daemonize yes

# If you run the server from upstart or systemd, the server can interact with your
# supervision tree. Options:
#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting the server into SIGSTOP mode
#                        requires "expect stop" in your upstart job config
#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
#                        on startup, and updating the server status on a regular
#                        basis.
#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
# Note: these supervision methods only signal "process is ready."
#       They do not enable continuous pings back to your supervisor.
#
# The default is "no". To run under upstart/systemd, you can simply uncomment
# the line below:
#
supervised systemd

# If a pid file is specified, the server writes it where specified at startup
# and removes it at exit.
#
# When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
# specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
# is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/var/run/redis.pid".
#
# Creating a pid file is best effort: if the server is not able to create it
# nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
#
# Note that on modern Linux systems "/run/valkey.pid" is more conforming
# and should be used instead.
pidfile /run/valkey.pid

# Specify the server verbosity level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
# nothing (nothing is logged)
loglevel notice

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# the server to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null

# syslog-enabled no

# Specify the syslog identity.
# syslog-ident redis

# Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
# syslog-facility local0

# To disable the built in crash log, which will possibly produce cleaner core
# dumps when they are needed, uncomment the following:
#
# crash-log-enabled no

# To disable the fast memory check that's run as part of the crash log, which
# will possibly let the server terminate sooner, uncomment the following:
#
# crash-memcheck-enabled no

# Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select
# a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where
# dbid is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1
databases 16

# By default the server shows an ASCII art logo only when started to log to the
# standard output and if the standard output is a TTY and syslog logging is
# disabled. Basically this means that normally a logo is displayed only in

#
# However it is possible to force the pre-4.0 behavior and always show a
# ASCII art logo in startup logs by setting the following option to yes.

################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################

# Save the DB to disk.
#
# save <seconds> <changes> [<seconds> <changes> ...]
#
# The server will save the DB if the given number of seconds elapsed and it
# surpassed the given number of write operations against the DB.
#
# Snapshotting can be completely disabled with a single empty string argument
# as in following example:
#
# save ""
#
# Unless specified otherwise, by default the server will save the DB:
#   * After 3600 seconds (an hour) if at least 1 change was performed
#   * After 300 seconds (5 minutes) if at least 100 changes were performed
#   * After 60 seconds if at least 10000 changes were performed
#
# You can set these explicitly by uncommenting the following line.
#
save 3600 1 300 100 60 10000

# By default the server will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
# (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting
# on disk properly, otherwise chances are that no one will notice and some
# disaster will happen.
#
# If the background saving process will start working again, the server will
# automatically allow writes again.
#
# However if you have setup your proper monitoring of the server
# and persistence, you may want to disable this feature so that the server will
# continue to work as usual even if there are problems with disk,
# permissions, and so forth.
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
# By default compression is enabled as it's almost always a win.
# If you want to save some CPU in the saving child set it to 'no' but
# the dataset will likely be bigger if you have compressible values or keys.
rdbcompression yes

# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it
# for maximum performances.
#
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
rdbchecksum yes

# Enables or disables full sanitization checks for ziplist and listpack etc when

# List ACLS here

# ACL LOG
#
# The ACL Log tracks failed commands and authentication events associated
# with ACLs. The ACL Log is useful to troubleshoot failed commands blocked
# by ACLs. The ACL Log is stored in memory. You can reclaim memory with
# ACL LOG RESET. Define the maximum entry length of the ACL Log below.
acllog-max-len 128

# Using an external ACL file
#
# Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use
# a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:
# if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the external
# ACL file, the server will refuse to start.
#
# The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the
# format that is used inside valkey.conf to describe users.
#
aclfile {{ valkey_conf_directory }}/users.acl

# IMPORTANT NOTE: "requirepass" is just a compatibility
# layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
#
# The requirepass is not compatible with aclfile option and the ACL LOAD
# command, these will cause requirepass to be ignored.
#
# requirepass

# The default Pub/Sub channels permission for new users is controlled by the
# acl-pubsub-default configuration directive, which accepts one of these values:
#
# allchannels: grants access to all Pub/Sub channels
# resetchannels: revokes access to all Pub/Sub channels
#
# acl-pubsub-default defaults to 'resetchannels' permission.
#
# acl-pubsub-default resetchannels

################################### CLIENTS ####################################

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as the server reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached the server will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# IMPORTANT: With a cluster-enabled setup, the max number of connections is also
# shared with the cluster bus: every node in the cluster will use two
# connections, one incoming and another outgoing. It is important to size the
# limit accordingly in case of very large clusters.
#
# maxclients 10000

############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################

# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached the server will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If the server can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', the server will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using the server as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
maxmemory {{ valkey_memory_limit }}mb

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how the server will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select one from the following behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for
# eviction, the server will return an error on write operations that require
# more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or
# modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,
# SORT (due to the STORE argument), and EXEC (if the transaction includes any
# command that requires memory).
#
# The default is:
#
maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. By default the server will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used least recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5

# Eviction processing is designed to function well with the default setting.
# If there is an unusually large amount of write traffic, this value may need to
# be increased.  Decreasing this value may reduce latency at the risk of
# eviction processing effectiveness
#   0 = minimum latency, 10 = default, 100 = process without regard to latency
#
# maxmemory-eviction-tenacity 10

# By default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting
# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means
# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the
# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.
#
# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually
# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica
# to have a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed
# to the replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure
# to understand what you are doing).
#
# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more
# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may
# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory
# and so forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they
# have enough memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the
# master hits the configured maxmemory setting.
#
# replica-ignore-maxmemory yes

# The server reclaims expired keys in two ways: upon access when those keys are
# found to be expired, and also in background, in what is called the
# "active expire key". The key space is slowly and interactively scanned
# looking for expired keys to reclaim, so that it is possible to free memory
# of keys that are expired and will never be accessed again in a short time.
#
# The default effort of the expire cycle will try to avoid having more than
# ten percent of expired keys still in memory, and will try to avoid consuming
# more than 25% of total memory and to add latency to the system. However
# it is possible to increase the expire "effort" that is normally set to
# "1", to a greater value, up to the value "10". At its maximum value the
# system will use more CPU, longer cycles (and technically may introduce
# more latency), and will tolerate less already expired keys still present
# in the system. It's a tradeoff between memory, CPU and latency.

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default the server asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the server process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) the server can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup the server will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check https://valkey.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly yes

# The base name of the append only file.
#
# The server uses a set of append-only files to persist the dataset
# and changes applied to it. There are two basic types of files in use:
#
# - Base files, which are a snapshot representing the complete state of the
#   dataset at the time the file was created. Base files can be either in
#   the form of RDB (binary serialized) or AOF (textual commands).
# - Incremental files, which contain additional commands that were applied
#   to the dataset following the previous file.
#
# In addition, manifest files are used to track the files and the order in
# which they were created and should be applied.
#
# Append-only file names are created by the server following a specific pattern.
# The file name's prefix is based on the 'appendfilename' configuration
# parameter, followed by additional information about the sequence and type.
#
# For example, if appendfilename is set to appendonly.aof, the following file
# names could be derived:
#
# - appendonly.aof.1.base.rdb as a base file.
# - appendonly.aof.1.incr.aof, appendonly.aof.2.incr.aof as incremental files.
# - appendonly.aof.manifest as a manifest file.

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# For convenience, the server stores all persistent append-only files in a dedicated
# directory. The name of the directory is determined by the appenddirname
# configuration parameter.

appenddirname "appendonly"

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# The server supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# the server may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of the server is
# the same as "appendfsync no". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# The server is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: The server remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the server
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where the server is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when the server itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# The server can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "valkey-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# the server will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# The server can create append-only base files in either RDB or AOF formats. Using
# the RDB format is always faster and more efficient, and disabling it is only
# supported for backward compatibility purposes.
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

# The server supports recording timestamp annotations in the AOF to support restoring
# the data from a specific point-in-time. However, using this capability changes
# the AOF format in a way that may not be compatible with existing AOF parsers.
aof-timestamp-enabled no

################################ SHUTDOWN #####################################

# Maximum time to wait for replicas when shutting down, in seconds.
#
# During shut down, a grace period allows any lagging replicas to catch up with
# the latest replication offset before the master exists. This period can
# prevent data loss, especially for deployments without configured disk backups.
#
# The 'shutdown-timeout' value is the grace period's duration in seconds. It is
# only applicable when the instance has replicas. To disable the feature, set
# the value to 0.
#
# shutdown-timeout 10

# When the server receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM, shutdown is initiated and by default
# an RDB snapshot is written to disk in a blocking operation if save points are configured.
# The options used on signaled shutdown can include the following values:
# default:  Saves RDB snapshot only if save points are configured.
#           Waits for lagging replicas to catch up.
# save:     Forces a DB saving operation even if no save points are configured.
# nosave:   Prevents DB saving operation even if one or more save points are configured.
# now:      Skips waiting for lagging replicas.
# force:    Ignores any errors that would normally prevent the server from exiting.
#
# Any combination of values is allowed as long as "save" and "nosave" are not set simultaneously.
# Example: "nosave force now"
#
# shutdown-on-sigint default
# shutdown-on-sigterm default

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The server Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells the server
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# The server latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a server instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0

################################ LATENCY TRACKING ##############################

# The server's extended latency monitoring tracks the per command latencies and enables
# exporting the percentile distribution via the INFO latencystats command,
# and cumulative latency distributions (histograms) via the LATENCY command.
#
# By default, the extended latency monitoring is enabled since the overhead
# of keeping track of the command latency is very small.
latency-tracking yes

# By default the exported latency percentiles via the INFO latencystats command
# are the p50, p99, and p999.

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# The server can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at https://valkey.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that the server will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  n     New key events (Note: not included in the 'A' class)
#  t     Stream commands
#  d     Module key type events
#  m     Key-miss events (Note: It is not included in the 'A' class)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxetd, so that the "AKE" string means all the events
#        (Except key-miss events which are excluded from 'A' due to their
#         unique nature).
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.
